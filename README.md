## 🖤💜 Dark Purple Team Humor

- Our code reviews happen in “purple prose” — we only comment in hex `#663399`.  
- Coffee is overrated; our purple tea fuels the midnight threat hunts.  
- We don’t do “dark mode”—we’re permanently in **ULTRA DARK PURPLE MODE**.  
- If you can’t handle the purple, you’re not ready for Team Dark Purple.  
- Legend says a bug turned purple on sight of our CI pipeline—and it never dared return.
